# Technical Case Study - FullStack

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The duration of this is 7 days. The test is achievable within a couple of hours, but we want to make sure each candidate has enough time to prepare it, think, and not do it in a rush.

Finally, there is no right or wrong answer. We want to evaluate your methodology and the way you approach to integrate design.
